ROUNDCUBE PLUS SKIN
===================

Roundcube Plus skins add a new look and extend the functionality of the Roundcube program.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
- Roundcube: 1.5, 1.6
- PHP: 7.4 or higher

INSTALLATION
------------
1. Copy the contents of the 'plugins' directory included in this package to the 'plugins' directory of your Roundcube installation.

2. Read the instructions in plugins/xskin/README for installing and configuring the xskin plugin. As explained there, you'll need to edit
the Roundcube config file to add 'xskin' to the plugins array and specify your license key. There are no special steps needed to install
xframework. It doesn't need to be added to the plugins array.

3. Copy the contents of the 'skins' directory included in this package to the 'skins' directory of your Roundcube installation.

4. If you'd like to use Outlook+ on the Roundcube login screen and as the default skin for the newly created user accounts, edit the file
[roundcube]/config/config.inc.php, find the line that begins with $config['skin'] and set it to 'outlook_plus'. If this line doesn't exist, add
it at the end of the file, like this:

$config['skin'] = 'outlook_plus';

5. If you'd like to edit the skin's default configuration, edit this file:

skins/outlook_plus/config.inc.php.

If the config file doesn't exist, rename skins/outlook_plus/config.inc.php.sample to skins/outlook_plus/config.inc.php.
